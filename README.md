# coADAPTr - Covalent Labeling Data Analysis Platform for High Throughput in r

An R package for analyzing covalent labeling-mass spectrometry data
coADAPTr is an R package for analyzing covalent labeling-mass
spectrometry experimental data that has been sequence searched on a
platform like Proteome Discoverer (v2.3+). The package provides
functions for quality control, data normalization, visualization, and
statistical analysis of covalent labeling-mass spectrometry data.

Features Quality Control: Check the quality of your data and remove
duplicates.

Visualization: Create informative plots to visualize the data and the
results of statistical analysis.

Statistical Analysis: Perform differential analysis, clustering, and
classification and extent of modification quantification of covalent
labeling-mass spectrometry data.
