coADAPTr - Covalent Labeling Data Analysis Platform for High Throughput in r
An R package for analyzing covalent labeling-mass spectrometry data
coADAPTr is an R package for analyzing covalent labeling-mass spectrometry experimental data that has been sequence searched on a platform like Proteome Discoverer. The package provides functions for quality control, data normalization, visualization, and statistical analysis of covalent labeling-mass spectrometry data.

Features
Quality control: check the quality of your data and remove outliers.
Data normalization: normalize covalent labeling-mass spectrometry data using various normalization methods.
Visualization: create informative plots to visualize the data and the results of statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis: perform differential analysis, clustering, and classification of covalent labeling-mass spectrometry data.
