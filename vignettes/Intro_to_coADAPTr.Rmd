This is an introduction to coADAPTr (Cocalent Labeling Automated Data Analysis Platform in R)

We can use a series of functions to help process raw mass spectrometry data that has been sequence searched.

The initial input is an excel sheet (.xlsx or .xls) that contains the minimum columns:
- MasterProteinAccessions
- UniprotID
- Modifications (Modification Type; Modification Position)
- Sequence (If using Proteome Discoverer 2.5> be sure to change "Annotated Sequence' to "Sequence")
- Precursor Abundance
- Spectrum File (Indicate Laser-L vs No Laser-NL Samples in the Spectrum File Names)
- Retention Time
